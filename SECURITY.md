# Security Documentation - HumanGPT

## Overview
This document outlines the production-level security measures implemented in the HumanGPT application.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. API Security
- **Secure API Routes**: All API calls now go through secure backend endpoints
- **Authentication**: Firebase JWT token verification for all API requests
- **Rate Limiting**: 60 requests per minute per user
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization and validation
- **CORS Protection**: Strict origin checking
- **Content Security Policy**: Implemented CSP headers

### 2. Environment Variables
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All API keys and sensitive data moved to environment variables
- **Server-Side Storage**: API keys stored securely on the server
- **Environment Separation**: Clear separation between development and production environments

### 3. Security Headers
- **X-Frame-Options**: DENY (prevents clickjacking)
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: nosniff (prevents MIME sniffing)
- **X-XSS-Protection**: 1; mode=block (XSS protection)
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: HTTPS enforcement
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Comprehensive CSP implementation
- **Referrer-Policy**: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricted browser features

### 4. Data Protection
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized
- **Output Encoding**: API responses are properly encoded
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries (Firebase)
- **XSS Prevention**: Content Security Policy and input validation
- **CSRF Protection**: SameSite cookies and token validation

### 5. Middleware Security
- **Request Filtering**: Blocks malicious patterns and file extensions
- **Directory Traversal Protection**: Prevents path traversal attacks
- **Brute Force Protection**: Rate limiting and IP blocking
- **Bot Protection**: User-Agent validation and suspicious pattern detection

### 6. Firebase Security
- **Firestore Rules**: Strict database access rules
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with proper token validation
- **Admin SDK**: Secure server-side Firebase operations
- **Analytics**: Production-only analytics

## Environment Variables Setup

### Required Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the following:

```bash
# Firebase Configuration (Client Side)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id

# Firebase Admin SDK (Server Side - Keep Secret!)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_service_account_email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key

# Gemini AI API Keys (Server Side - Keep Secret!)
GEMINI_API_KEY_1=your_api_key_1
GEMINI_API_KEY_2=your_api_key_2
GEMINI_API_KEY_3=your_api_key_3
# ... up to 7 keys for redundancy

# Production URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://yourdomain.com/api

# Environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Deployment Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All environment variables are properly set
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in the codebase
- [ ] `.env` files are in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Firebase security rules are properly configured
- [ ] API keys have proper restrictions in Google Cloud Console

### Production Deployment
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] Domain is properly configured
- [ ] CDN is configured with proper security headers
- [ ] Database access is restricted to application servers only
- [ ] Monitoring and logging are enabled
- [ ] Backup strategies are in place

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Security scan completed
- [ ] Rate limiting is working
- [ ] All security headers are present
- [ ] API endpoints are not directly accessible
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information

## Security Monitoring

### What to Monitor
- Unusual API request patterns
- Failed authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Error rates and types
- Database access patterns

### Recommended Tools
- Firebase Security Rules simulator
- Google Cloud Security Center
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- DDoS protection services

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Never commit sensitive data to version control
2. Use environment variables for all configuration
3. Validate all inputs on both client and server
4. Implement proper error handling
5. Regular security audits and updates

### For Deployment
1. Use HTTPS everywhere
2. Implement proper backup strategies
3. Monitor application logs
4. Keep dependencies updated
5. Regular penetration testing

## Incident Response

### In Case of Security Breach
1. Immediately rotate all API keys
2. Review and update Firebase security rules
3. Check access logs for suspicious activity
4. Update all environment variables
5. Notify users if personal data is affected

## Updates and Maintenance

### Regular Security Tasks
- [ ] Monthly security dependency updates
- [ ] Quarterly security audits
- [ ] Annual penetration testing
- [ ] Continuous monitoring of security advisories

## Contact

For security concerns or reporting vulnerabilities, contact the development team immediately.
